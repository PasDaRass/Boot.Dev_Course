Now that we have pygame installed, let's write just a bit of boilerplate code so that we have a runnable program to build on.

Create a new file called main.py.
On the first line, import pygame:
```
# this allows us to use code from
# the open-source pygame library
# throughout this file
import pygame
```
Write a main function that simply prints "Starting Asteroids!" (use this exact text).
Add this if statement to the end of the file:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
