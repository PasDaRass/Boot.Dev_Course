# Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

<ul>
  <li>
    
Introduce you to multi-file Python projects 
  </li>
  <li>
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming 
    
  </li>
  <li>
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project! 
    
  </li>
</ul>
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. <br />
Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.
