The next 9 characters are broken up into 3 sets of rwx and represent the permissions themselves for the "owner", "group", and "others", in order. Each group of 3 represents the permissions for reading, writing, and executing, in order. So, for example:
<br /><br />
<em>rwx: All permissions</em>

<em>rw-: Read and write, but not execute</em>

<em>r-x: Read and execute, but not write</em>
