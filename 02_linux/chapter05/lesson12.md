<h3>Kill Process</h3>

```
kill PID
```
PID stands for "process ID". Every process that's running on your machine has a unique ID. The ps, "process status" command can be used to list the processes running on your machine, and their IDs:
```
ps aux
```
The "aux" options just mean "show all processes, including those owned by other users, and show extra information about each process".
