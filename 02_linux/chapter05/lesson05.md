<h4>Help</h4>
By convention, most production-ready CLI tools have a "help" option that prints information about how to use the tool. It's usually accessed with one of the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    
--help (flag)
  </li>
  <li>
    
  </li>
-h (flag)
  <li>
    
help (first positional argument)
  </li>
</ul>

The "help" output is often easier to parse than a full man page. It's usually more of a quick start guide than a full manual.
