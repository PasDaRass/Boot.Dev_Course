<h3>
  Manual
</h3>

<em>open the man pages for the 'man' command</em>
```
man man
```
You can search for text in the manual by pressing the / key and typing your search, then pressing enter. Let's try to look up what the -r flag does for the ls command:
```
man ls
# type '/-r' to start searching

# press 'n' to jump to the next result

# press 'N' to go back if you went too far
```
