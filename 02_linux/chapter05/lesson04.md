<h3>Positional Arguments</h3>

In a shell, commands (programs) can also take arguments. For example, the cd command takes a single argument (the directory to change to):
```
cd /home/wagslane
```
Other commands might take multiple arguments. For example, the mv command takes two arguments: the file to move, and the destination to move it to:
```
mv file.txt newfile.txt
```
