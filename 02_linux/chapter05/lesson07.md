"Standard Output", usually called "standard out" or "stdout", is the default place where programs print their output. It's just a stream of data that prints to your terminal, but we'll talk later about how it can be redirected to other places.

All programming languages have a simple way to print to stdout. In Python, it's the print function:

```
print("Hello world")
# Hello world
```
In a shell, it's the echo command:
```
echo "Hello world"
# Hello world
```
