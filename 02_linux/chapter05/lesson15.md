<h3>Top</h3>
<p>
  The top command is a powerful tool that allows you to see which programs are using the most resources on your computer.
</p>
<p>
  By default, top sorts the processes by CPU usage, with the most CPU-intensive processes at the top. Another useful resource to sort by is memory (RAM) usage. To sort by memory usage, press M (uppercase) while top is running. 
  MacOS users may need to use o mem <enter>.
