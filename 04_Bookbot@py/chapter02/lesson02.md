To be able to analyze a book, first we need to have a book to analyze!

<h4>Assignment</h4>
<p>"Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley is in the public domain, so let's start with that.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    
Create a directory in your bookbot project called books, and a new books/frankenstein.txt file.
  </li>
  <li>
Open a browser and navigate to project Gutenberg here. Copy and paste the entire contents of the page into your frankenstein.txt file.
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
Create a .gitignore file in your bookbot project root directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    
Add the /books directory to your .gitignore file. Its typically best practice to only commit code to your repository, not data.
  </li>
  <li>
    
We don't want to save the entire book in our Git repository. Generally speaking, Git is for code, not for data.
  </li>
</ol>
