# Count Words
Time for our first bit of data analysis! Let's count the words in the book.

<h4>Assignment</h4>

Write a new function that accepts the text from the book as a string, and returns the number of words in the string. <br /> 
The .split() method will be helpful here. <br />
Instead of printing the books contents, print this message to the console:
```
{num_words} words found in the document
```
