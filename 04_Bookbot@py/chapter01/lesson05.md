# First Commit
Remember, Git commits are used to save snapshots of your code at a specific point in time. Each commit should represent a single logical change to your codebase. For example, a commit might:
<ul>
  <li>
    
Add a new feature
  </li>
  <li>
    
Fix a new bug
  </li>
  <li>
    
Rework a bit of your code to be more readable
  </li>
</ul>
