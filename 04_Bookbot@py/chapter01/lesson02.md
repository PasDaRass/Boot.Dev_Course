Many developers have spent years writing code, but never develop good organization and so they end up with project directories strewn haphazardly across their filesystem. <br />

To be clear, you can organize your code however you prefer on your machine, <br />
but this method has served me very well, and it's based on how Golang used to enforce code organization. <br />
My system is simple:
```
~/workspace/HOSTNAME/USERNAME/REPONAME
```
For example:
<p>
  
~/workspace/github.com/bootdotdev/curriculum
</p>
<p>
  
~/workspace/github.com/wagslane/go-rabbitmq
</p>
