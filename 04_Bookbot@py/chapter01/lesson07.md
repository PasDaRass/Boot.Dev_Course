Create a new file called main.py. You can use the VS Code file explorer or just run the command:
```
touch main.py
```
Open the file in your editor and paste in some simple "hello boots" code. Don't forget to save your code after you write it!
```
print("greetings boots")
```
Run your program:
`python3 main.py`

If your code printed "greetings boots" to the console, pat yourself on the back! You've got a professional Python development environment up and running!
