# Readme
A README.md is a markdown documentation file that's supposed to explain what your project is and how to run it.
<br />
Open your README.md in your editor and update its contents (be sure it matches, we'll be checking):
```
# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
```
The [anchor](link) syntax is how you make a link in markdown.
