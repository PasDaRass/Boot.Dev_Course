# Git Clone
By creating a project on GitHub first and then cloning it down, the remote connection between your local project and GitHub is configured automatically. 
If you start your project on your local machine and push it up later, there are a few more steps involved.


Clone your remote bookbot repo down onto your local machine at the location you want your new project directory to live. 
If you're following my system that means from somewhere like `~/workspace/github.com/{username}` you would run
```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/bookbot
```
