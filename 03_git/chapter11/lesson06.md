# What to Ignore
We've talked about how to ignore files, but the deeper question is what should you ignore? Here are some rules of thumb for coding projects:
<ul>
  <li>
    
Ignore things that can be generated (e.g. compiled code, minified files, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    
Ignore dependencies (e.g. node_modules, venv, packages, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    
Ignore things that are personal or specific to how you like to work (e.g. editor settings)
  </li>
  <li>
Ignore things that are sensitive or dangerous (e.g. .env files, passwords, API keys, etc.)
    
  </li>
</ul>
