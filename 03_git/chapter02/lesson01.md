Navigate to somewhere on your filesystem where you'd like to store your project. Once you're there, create a new directory called webflyx and cd into it.
```
mkdir webflyx
cd webflyx
```
Once inside, create a new Git repository:
```
git init
```
You should now have a hidden .git directory in your webflyx directory. This means you've successfully created a new Git repository! List (ls -a) the contents of the directory to confirm.
