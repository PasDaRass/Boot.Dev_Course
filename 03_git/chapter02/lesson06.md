The git log command shows a history of the commits in a repository. This is what makes Git a version control system. You can see:
<ul>
  <li>
    
Who made a commit
  </li>
  <li>
    
When the commit was made
  </li>
  <li>
    
What was changed
  </li>
  <li>
    
A Commit Hash
  </li>
</ul>
Each commit has a unique identifier called a "commit hash". This is a long string of characters that uniquely identifies the commit.<br /> 
Here's an example of mine:

```
5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f
```

For convenience, you can refer to any commit or change within Git by using the first 7 characters of its hash.
