A file can be in one of several states in a Git repository. Here are a few important ones:
<ul>
  <li>
    
untracked: Not being tracked by Git
  </li>
  <li>
    
staged: Marked for inclusion in the next commit
  </li>
  <li>
    
committed: Saved to the repository's history
  </li>
</ul>
The git status command shows you the current state of your repo. It will tell you which files are untracked, staged, and committed.
