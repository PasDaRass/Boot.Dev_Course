In Git, commands are divided into high-level ("porcelain") commands and low-level ("plumbing") commands. <br />
The porcelain commands are the ones that you will use most often as a developer to interact with your code. <br />
Some porcelain commands are:
<ul>
  <li>
    
git status
  </li>
  <li>
    
git add
  </li>
  <li>
    
git commit
  </li>
  <li>
    
git push
  </li>
  <li>
    
git pull
  </li>
  <li>
    
git log
  </li>
</ul>
Some examples of plumbing commands are:
<ul>
  <li>
    
git apply
  </li>
  <li>
git hash-object
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
git commit-tree
  </li>
</ul>
