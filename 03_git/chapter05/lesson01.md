A Git branch allows you to keep track of different changes separately.

<p>
  A branch is just a named pointer to a specific commit. When you create a branch, you are creating a new pointer to a specific commit. <br />
  The commit that the branch points to is called the tip of the branch.
</p>

<p>
  Because a branch is just a pointer to a commit, 
  they're lightweight and "cheap" resource-wise to create. <br />
  When you create 10 branches, you're not creating 10 copies of your project on your hard drive.
