Throughout the rest of this course, we will use text to represent branches and commits. For example:

```
A - B - C  main
```

means a branch called main with 3 commits. C is the most recent commit (the tip), B is the previous commit, and A is the commit before that. <br />
To represent multiple branches, we'll use multiple lines:

```
    D - E  other_branch
  /
A - B - C  main
```
other_branch can be represented as A > B > E
