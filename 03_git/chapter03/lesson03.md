When Git stores objects (like commits, trees, blobs), it doesn't just use the entire hash as a filename. Instead, it:
<ul>
  <li>
    
Takes the first 2 characters of the hash as a directory name
  </li>
  <li>
    
Uses the remaining characters as the filename inside that directory
  </li>
</ul>
So if your commit hash is something like 65cf0768bef00a6df9c52d156625675e1045a504, Git would store it at:
.git/objects/65/cf0768bef00a6df9c52d156625675e1045a504
