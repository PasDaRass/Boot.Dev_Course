This is why developers merge branches on GitHub through pull requests.

On GitHub, a pull request is a way to propose changes, typically to the rest of your team, or to the maintainer of a project you're contributing to.

Pull requests allow team members to see what changes are being proposed and to discuss them before they are merged into the main codebase.
