GitHub is the most popular website for Git repositories (projects) online. That is, for hosting "remotes" on a central website. GitHub serves several purposes:
<ul>
  <li>
    
As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
  </li>
  <li>
    
As a central place to share your code and collaborate on it with others
  </li>
  <li>
As a public portfolio for your coding projects
    
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Git != GitHub</h4>
It's important to understand that Git and GitHub are not the same! Git is an open-source command line tool for managing code files. GitHub and its primary competitors, GitLab and Bitbucket, are commercial web products that use Git. Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.
