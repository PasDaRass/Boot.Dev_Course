This is a common workflow when working with Git on a team of developers:
<ol>
  <li>
Create a branch for a new change
    
  </li>
  <li>
Make the change
    
  </li>
  <li>
Merge the branch back into main (or whatever branch your team dubs the "default" branch)
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
Remove the branch
  </li>
  <li>
    
Repeat
  </li>
</ol>

To delete an unnecessary branch:
```
git branch -d add_classics
```
