# Sync files between new remote and local repo
Merge the remote origin/main into the local repo's main branch. Because we are on an empty branch, we should get a nice clean fast-forward merge.

Make sure it worked with git log. You should see all the same commits on your local main branch as you do on the remote origin/main branch.
