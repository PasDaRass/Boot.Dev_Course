    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result

radius = 5
area = area_of_circle(radius)
print(area)
# 78.5

Q: Why is the variable called 'radius' outside the function, but 'r' inside the function?
A: Because only the value of the variable is passed to the function. It is then assigned a new variable called 'r'
